<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Classic Swedish Meatballs, traditionally served with boiled potatoes, are a hearty meal the whole family will love!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>½ yellow onion, finely chopped </li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons fine salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup milk</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>

    <li>¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
</ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in butter until onion begins to turn translucent, about 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer onion mixture to a large bowl. Add milk, eggs, bread crumbs, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and cayenne pepper to the breadcrumb mixture; stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Mix beef and pork into the bread crumb mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat; whisk flour into butter and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk beef broth into butter mixture.</li>
    <li>Increase heat to medium-high, whisk cream into mixture and bring to a simmer. Stir sugar and Worcestershire sauce into gravy. Simmer until slightly thickened, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly coat foil with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Roll 2 to 3 tablespoons meatball mixture into a ball using wet hands; repeat with remaining meatball mixture. Place meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Transfer meatballs to the gravy and cook over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.</li>
